# **PLEXKITS API Pusher**
Welcome to PLEXKITS API Pusher\! This repository has been initialized to build a software application using a state-of-the-art, AI-driven development process (MAIA - Modular AI-driven Application).

## **Your Role: The Human Orchestrator**
Your primary role is not to write code, but to provide the vision, make key decisions, and review the AI's work. You are the architect and the project manager; the AI is your development team.

## **How to Get Started: The 3-Step Process**
This project follows a structured, three-phase process to go from idea to finished application.

### **Step 1: Complete the Kickstart (kickstart.md)**
This is the most important first step.

1. Open the kickstart.md file in the root of this project.
2. Fill out each section with as much detail as you can. The more specific your goals and features, the better the AI can understand your vision.

### **Step 2: Collaborate with the MAIA Assistant (Phase 1\)**
Once your kickstart.md is complete, you will engage in a dialogue with the MAIA AI Assistant. In this phase, you and the AI will:

* **Select a Technology Stack:** Choose the right tools for the job.
* **Define Project Rules:** Establish the coding standards and best practices.
* **Specify Every Module:** Create a detailed blueprint (/upd) that tells the AI agents *exactly* what to build for PLEXKITS API Pusher.

Your role here is to answer the AI's questions and give final approval on the generated blueprint.

### **Step 3: Hand-off to the AI Developers (Phase 2\)**
Once you approve the complete blueprint (/upd), the development process is handed off to a team of autonomous AI agents.

* The agents will read the blueprint and generate the PLEXKITS API Pusher application's source code into the /src directory.
* You can monitor their progress and, once complete, review the final application.

**To begin, please open kickstart.md.**

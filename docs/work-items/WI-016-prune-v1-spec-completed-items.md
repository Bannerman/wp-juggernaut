# WI-016: Prune v1.0 Spec Completed Items

## Status
To Do

## Description
`docs/v1.0-spec.md` is now the active planning document, but several listed "needs to happen" items are already complete in code. Prune or mark completed items so the spec remains execution-focused and avoids duplicate work.

## Module
documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- `docs/v1.0-spec.md` distinguishes clearly between completed work and open work.
- Completed items are either removed from action lists or marked as done with date/context.
- Remaining implementation plan tasks map cleanly to existing/new work items in `docs/work-items/`.
